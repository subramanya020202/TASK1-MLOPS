The my_counter project is a Python package providing a simple Counter class with functionalities for incrementing, decrementing, resetting, and randomizing a counter
value. The project is organized according to Python packaging standards, with directories like counter/ containing the core code, setup.py defining configuration and 
dependencies, and dist/ storing the final wheel file after building. The use of a wheel (.whl) package is particularly beneficial, as it allows for fast, efficient 
installation. Wheel packages are pre-built and compressed, meaning they can be installed by simply copying files rather than compiling source code, saving time. 
Additionally, wheels facilitate automatic dependency management, as pip will detect and install any required libraries, like numpy in this case. Wheel packaging also
supports platform compatibility, with the option to create platform-specific wheels if needed. The standardized file names help users and package managers keep track 
of versioning. Together, these features make the my_counter project easy to distribute, install, and use across various environments, enhancing reliability and
supporting best practices for Python development and deployment.
